1.write a blog on difference between HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP2:

HTTP/1.1
HTTP/2
It works on the textual format.
It works on the binary protocol.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It compresses data by itself.
It uses HPACK for data compression.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript:

*Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
4.Read about IP address,port,HTTP methods,MAC address:
IP ADDRESS:
*An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet. Typically assigned by an internet service provider (ISP), an IP address is an online device address used for communicating across the internet.
PORT:
*Ports provide a multiplexing service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address. In the client–server model of application architecture, multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service.
HTTP METHODS:
*The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client.
MAC ADDRESS:
*MAC (Media Access Control) is a 48-bit unique identifier assigned to Network Interface Controller. It is a physical address associated with every networking device.
The Data Link Layer uses a MAC address to route a data packet from a source to its destination. It is separated into two sublayers in the IEEE 802 standard:
Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer
Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer
1.Write a blog on the difference between document & window objects:
*Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
What about the document object then?
The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
That seems simple enough. But what happens once an IFRAME is introduced? Uh oh… frameage.
An iframe actually is considered as a new window with its own document loaded into it. Here is where it may seem a little odd, but does make sense if you think about it. The original, parent window, is responsible for other windows to be loaded, not the document.
